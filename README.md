# web-development-projects

This repo contains a couple web dev projects that I've worked on. The stack used here was : Node.js, Express and MongoDB.

1. YelpCamp: I created this as part of Colt Steele's Web Development program. YelpCamp is basically a blog and review site for 
hypothetical campsites.

2. sat-testing-site: This is a basic app I developed to help high schooler's practice their SAT test taking capabilities.
Students are timed for each section and enter their answers on the site. Their answers are then sent to them in a report.
